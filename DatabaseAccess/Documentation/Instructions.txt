How to run this:

1) Create and configure SQL Server for this app. Update connection string, create DB via EFCore docs in Commands file.

2) Download the latest .osm files to use from Geofabrik.de and unzip them to the appropriate folder.

3) Assuming this is a first setup, Run OsmXmlParser with these arguments in order (separately, not all at once):
-trimXmlFiles(reads all .osm files in a folder, saves as JSON data to another folder. Crashes pretty often in .NET 5 Preview with extremely vague "System.EngineException" error. Will take several runs to complete)
-readSPOIs (Reads the JSON files that cover single interesting items, saves them to DB in SinglePointsOfInterest table)
-readRawWays (Reads the JSON files that save all the raw OSM way info, saves them to DB in MapData table)
-readProcessedWays (Reads the JSON files that contain condensed approximations of the ways, saves to the DB in ProcessedWays table)

4)... manually make spatial index in Sql Server? Still getting here

for changes that affect everything (EX: I changed tag types to process, i want new ways/updates from OSM), run OsmXmlParser with -resetXml and -resetJson, then follow step 3 again
For changes that only affect processedWays/SPOIs (EX: testing a better approximation algorithm for ProcessedWays, changing schema on SPOI db table), i can read in existing JSON files instead of OSM XML
