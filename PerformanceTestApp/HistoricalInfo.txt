PerformanceTracker EntityFrameworkCore total  /average speed: 1793 / 17ms.
PerformanceTracker EntityFrameworkCore NoChangeTracking total /average speed: 80 / 0ms.
PerformanceTracker Sproc total / average speed: 71 / 0ms.
Decision: use entities with changetracking off for performance tracker. Keeps DB access consistent and in EFCore.

S2VsPlusCode 9/30/2020:
PlusCode conversion total / average time: 10 / 0 ms
S2 conversion total / average time: 7 / 0 ms
Decision: Sticking to pluscodes. Can do 1000 conversion in 1ms, and still drastically more useful for human-facing stuff than S2 cells.
